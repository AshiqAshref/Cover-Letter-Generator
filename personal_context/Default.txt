but got into a bit more depth on my tecnical expertice to make it more attractive to potential hirers. focus more on the stuff ive done in the embedded systems, like how reliable it is, corrects errors it self, basically takes care of it self, have redundancies on redundancies, can work if a lot of the many compnents goes down etc all while being extremly memmory effitient and fast with reliable cusom communication algorithm with error correction, collition detection, timeout, retry on fail etc. an about my indepth library, archetecture, device understanding,my indepth understanding of the c++ language and exploiting it while understanding its limitations and bypassing it. let me also explain a bit about the electronics so uou understand a bit more. in the arduino driver side there is:   2 max7219 ics controlling 16 RGB leds to show the status of each box,  there is 2 SN74S151 multiplexors connected to 16 lever switches that senses if a box has been taken out or not, and  lcd menu using i2c, 5 extra buttons for the cusom menu ive created implemented in the lcd_menu class in arduino driver where you can set daylight saving, re calibrate motors, activate access point in the esp controller, see the server status and set ips for servers , and many more. it also connected to a stepper motor driver module ive created which have a drv8825 controlling the Y axis lead screw using the nema17 stepper, and 2 A4988 stepper controllers controlling x axis drive belt and z axis lead screw giving 3d movement. each axis also have homing sensors or limit switches. as we mentioned before, each box have their own rgb led and sensor. it also have its own locking mechanism which automatically locks when pushed in. when a medicine needs to be dispensed, the stepper motor unlocks the box and pushes it out. also note the cusom library implementation to reduce the size of the data json for the arduino driver, and the esp32s ability to work both online and offline like set and forget. the arduino driver is also connected to esp32 for direcxt communication.Arduino driver is also connected to an rtc module so it can keep time independantly without the need for esp32. which mean each module is self suffitient. now in esp32, it is connected to a custom made sd card module with an sd card to store data, a oled display for debugging only and not offitial production. and all that is powered by a custom power supply designed and build by me. also talk about the custom logging algorith and the complex database and data engineering and management show cased in the spring boot backend.

================PAST PROMPTS========================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


these are the questions ive asked the copilot ai to get all these above prompts:

1) im planning on creating a description for this project on my resume. my project is 1 driver which is in _Arduino-Driver folder, 1 esp server on _ESP-server folder, 1 spring boot server which is in _Server_V22 folder,1 same as springboot server but done on java servlet which is in _Server_servlet folder, 1 sql database, and 1 angular front end which is in _MedicineManagerWebPage folder. can you create an attractive description to put on my resume ? in esp32 and arduino i also created my own version of basic freeRTOS implementation in the communication handler. and amny more stuff like extra functions for arduinoJson library and custom memmory mapper, these are just examples. feel free to make it as attractive as possible and show off my tecnical expertise and skill.

2)no the stuff i provided was for context only. now using that , and everything yove learned about my system from before prompts, can you create a complete resume for me

3) ok create an attractive section for me about this project i can put on my resume. also include an attractive breif description that i can put on the starting of my resume that will integure the hirers to look at the rest of my resume or will make them need to know more about me

4) see what all you can extract from these subsystems and create a section to put in my resum about this project that shows off my skill and tecnical understanding


5) but do note that the 3 projects mentioned here are the same. the 3-axis Robotic Arm with IOT Capabilities, the heletron and the project i was taking about with the copilot ai is the same. can you redo it with the new information? also create a very attractive and intreguing introduction to the resume that makes the hirers want to read more . also create short attractive description for the project that makes the hirers want to know more about the project and show off my tecnical expertice. basically try to combile all the prompts ive given to the ai which ive describe in the file ive attached before and create a irresistable professonal resume for me

6) good job. now let me help u understand something before the next generation. imagine you re a hirer an you have 1000s or resumes to go trough. as a hirer you are renting a person for the job. the job might requre you hire 2 person, but you only have money to hire 1 person. so you have to hire that 1 person carefully. now let me explain the gravity of hiring a person. when you hire someone, you are renting someone with a huge payout. which mean its a avery expensive buy. secondly, when you hire someone, you expect all your problems to go away. or share the current stress or load of the project to someone therefore decreasing the pressure on you. depending on how good the hire is, the pressure on the hirer becomes lesser. like its inversly proportional. the more good the hire, the less pressure on the hirer. now hes not only looking for a jack and master of all trades but also someone who wouldnt let him down, someone who is relaiable , independant, creates trustablke producs where he can rest the reputation of the company with. and also a person who would do all that on time. also note taht the hirer will have to got trough 1000s of resumes with work experience experience and i have no work experience other that this portfolio project which did allow me to learn in depth about everything and explore my own path in depth also by studying my favourite subject which is embedded sytems in more depth than a person with work experience in similar field, but more hirers arent privy tothat information cuz it is the social convention when it comes to hiring. with this new information in mind and empasising the informations from my previous prompts, create a resume that as a hirer with 1000+ resumes in hand will stand out to you. remember. this is for embedded enginerr or robotic engineering jobs

7) good work but please keep it professonal . no words like Guardian, Alchemy whispere etc. professonal, no story telling. resume is logical. 100% and short. re do the previous prompt but with these new parameters in mind

8) so my last last resume sucked. can you create a better captivating one for me with all the prompts ive included above where it should be captivating and have captivating intro to my resume that makes the hirers want to know more and the same for my project.. and mybe edit my skills a bit to make it better or simpler or more tecnical or less tecnical what ever it requres

9) im new to the workforce but i am very good with computers especially algorithms, and embedded system programming like arduinos and microcontrollers. im also into electrnics and steppers and sendors. im also good at creating full systems including networking, databases, and full stack dev in angular and spring boot java servlet etc. i can code in a lot of languages too.  the only issue is i have no work experience as i just graduated and did not do any internships. but i am way better than any of the grads currently graduating. with a deeper understanding from the very base level to the point i have designed basic processors using and digital gates in logisim and have a solid and deep understanding of the stuff i know so far. but i have trouble putting all of these into words. oh an ive also have made a functioning robotic system with build in menus and wifi and iot and 3 axis arms and different types of sensor and led arrays and many contingencies and fialsafes to the point my robot can run even if 50 percent of the supporting modules fail. all my code is written from scratch with failsafes in mind and and all algorithms and communication protocols are designed by me alone. but its hard to write all that in a paper with perfect grammar and with the right tonne. 

10) good job. now let me help u understand something before the next generation. imagine you re a hirer an you have 1000s or resumes to go trough. as a hirer you are renting a person for the job. the job might requre you hire 2 person, but you only have money to hire 1 person. so you have to hire that 1 person carefully. now let me explain the gravity of hiring a person. when you hire someone, you are renting someone with a huge payout. which mean its a avery expensive buy. secondly, when you hire someone, you expect all your problems to go away. or share the current stress or load of the project to someone therefore decreasing the pressure on you. depending on how good the hire is, the pressure on the hirer becomes lesser. like its inversly proportional. the more good the hire, the less pressure on the hirer. now hes not only looking for a jack and master of all trades but also someone who wouldnt let him down, someone who is relaiable , independant, creates trustablke producs where he can rest the reputation of the company with. and also a person who would do all that on time. also note taht the hirer will have to got trough 1000s of resumes with work experience experience and i have no work experience other that this portfolio project which did allow me to learn in depth about everything and explore my own path in depth also by studying my favourite subject which is embedded sytems in more depth than a person with work experience in similar field, but more hirers arent privy tothat information cuz it is the social convention when it comes to hiring. with this new information in mind and empasising the informations from my previous prompts, create a resume that as a hirer with 1000+ resumes in hand will stand out to you. remember. this is for embedded enginerr or robotic engineering jobs

I'm confident I can contribute immediately to your team. Let's discuss how I can bring value to your organization.

ok, so ive heard that "patients"in aged care gets abused. They also forget to take their medications on time. Sometimes they are given unauthorised pills by the "aged care workers" to remove unwanted behaviours and many more issues. So i made this device called "heletron" that you can assign to a "patient" which will enable you to add as many "robots" as the "patient" needs. This allows it to be tailorable to a specific "patient's" needs. To give an example "heletron" is like a mobile phone and the "robots" are like apps where you can install and uninstall "robots" as you need. "Robots" can also interact with each other by sharing data trough "heletron".

 For "heletron", the first "robot" i created is called the "Pill Dispenser". "Pill Dispenser" is capable of dispensing medications to "patients" automatically when it gets a "trigger". These "triggers" can be anything: "specific time", "external stimuli from one of the sensors like light sensor so the patient can take his medication when he wakes up and turns on the light", "external stimuli from one of the robots like his smartwatch bio monitor to dispense medicine when his sugar drops or pressure irregularities" etc.

 Now lets talk how it works. Each medicine is stored in an array of locked boxes. when a "trigger" is received, the "Pill dispenser" checks which boxes should be pushed out for that "trigger". Then using an arm controlled by 3 stepper motors, it unlocks the box and pushes the medicine out. Each box is equipped with an "interaction sensor" that checks to see if the unlocked box have been interacted with or not:- indicating whether the "patient" took the medication or not. Each boxes are also equipped with "RGB LED indicators" indicating the boxes status which are "taken", "Missed" and "Upcoming medication". 

 Now lets talk relation. At a point 1 "heletron" will belong to 1 "patient" only and vice versa. 1 "heletron" can have multiple "robots" like our "pill dispenser" connected to it .however 1 "robot" can belong to only one "heletron". "Main server" can have many "heletrons" under it. however 1 "heletron" can connect to only 1 "Main Server".

 "Users" can interact with any and all "heletrons" connected to "Main Server" and its robots using the "Dashboard Webapp". Using this "Dashboard Webapp" they can see all operational data reported back by the robots stored in a "heletron". The "pill dispenser" sends "operational data" to the "heletron" where it is stored. "Operational data" of the "Pill dispenser" contains information about all the pills the "patient" took including name of the medicine, time, trigger, and if the "patient" took the medication or missed it. It also tells how many pills are remaining and alerts "users" if a pill is about to finish. "humans" can also manage pills like adding, deleting or updating but only authorised "users" like doctors and not unauthorised ones like nurses or aged care workers are allowed to make changes. You can also assign "triggers" from other "robots" or "sensors" to a box in the pill dispenser the "Dashboard Webapp". like wise u can control the functions of all robots connected to a "Heletron".

 Now lets talk what each system has. "Main Server"(running apache tomcat using java servlet, java) is responsible for communication between "heletrons", "Dashboard Webapp"(using angular and node.js, written using typescript, javascript, jquery, html, css) and "Server database"(MySQL Server). The "server database" have all information about all devices and robots connected to "Main server".

 Each "Heletron"(made with node MCU) has its own "Embedded Database"(SD card module, C++) carrying "operational data" about all robots connected to it. "heletron" talks to "Main server" wirelessly trough WIFI(ESP8226). It also has a "setup website"(HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++) which is useful for setting up "heletron" for the first time or trouble shooting "heletron". It automatically shows the "setup website" if the device cant connect to the WIFI or the "Main server". With the "setup website" you can provide your WIFI details and Ip address of "Main server". "heletron" also have a custom 5 button "lcd display" with a built in menu that shows "operational data", allows u to view and setup Ip address, do calibration for the "robots", do basic error checks and configure basic functions.

 The "pill dispenser" is running on an Arduino mega. It is connected to the "interaction sensor"(Using de-multiplexer circuit) and the  "RGB LED indicators"(using M54564FP darlington array and DM163 controller) in each box. It also interacts with 3 stepper motors(neema 17 using A4988 Driver) responsible for controlling the arm which unlocks and pushes the box out when a "trigger" is received. It is also connected to homing switches which are used to calibrate the positions of the steppers motors. Each individual component is powered by a power supply unit i designed.
